# Deploy-Microservices-application-in-Kubernetes-with-Production-Security-Best-Practices


## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a microservices-based online shop application on a Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) cluster. It focuses on implementing production and security best practices using Kubernetes, Redis, and Linode's managed Kubernetes service.

## Technologies Used

- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: For orchestrating containerized applications.
- **Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE)**: A managed Kubernetes service by Linode.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- **Linux**: The operating system for both local and cloud environments.

## Project Structure

### 1. Kubernetes Cluster Setup

- **Cluster Creation**: Provisioned a Kubernetes cluster on Linode using their managed service. This includes configuring node pools to handle the applicationâ€™s workloads.
- **kubectl Configuration**: Set up `kubectl` to interact with the Linode Kubernetes cluster by saving the provided `kubeconfig` file to `~/.kube/config`.

### 2. Application Deployment

- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Created and applied Kubernetes manifests for deploying the microservices of the online shop application. This includes:
  - **Deployments**: Defines how each microservice should be deployed, including container images, replicas, and resource requests/limits.
  - **Services**: Exposes the microservices within the cluster or to the outside world.

### 3. Redis Setup

- **Deployment**: Deployed Redis using Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, to handle caching and data storage needs.

### 4. Ingress Configuration

- **Ingress Resource**: Configured Ingress to manage external access to the services. This includes:
  - **Routing Rules**: Defined routing rules to direct HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the appropriate microservices.
  - **TLS/SSL**: Enabled HTTPS by creating a TLS secret and updating the Ingress resource. This ensures secure communication between clients and the application.

### 5. Security Best Practices

- **Network Policies**: Implemented network policies to control traffic between different services, enhancing the security of internal communications.
- **Resource Management**: Set resource requests and limits for containers to ensure efficient usage of cluster resources and to prevent resource contention.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Linode account with access to Linode Kubernetes Engine.
- `kubectl` installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
- Helm installed for deploying Redis and other applications.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/microservices-kubernetes.git
   cd microservices-kubernetes
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
